  <h1>Nikhil's Notes</h1>
The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Front-end
developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web page
or app including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.
  <h2>HTML</h2>
Hypertext Markup Language is the core of a website, providing the overall design
and functionality. The most recent version was released in late 2017 and is known
as HTML5.2. The updated version includes more tools aimed at web application
developers as well as adjustments made to improve interoperability.
<h2>CSS</h2>
Cascading style sheets give developers a flexible, precise way to create attractive,
interactive website designs.
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
This event-based language is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML
web pages. It allows developers to access elements separate from the main HTML
page, as well as respond to server-side events.
<h2>Back end</h2>
The back end, also called the server side, consists of the server which provides
data on request, the application which channels it, and the database which
organizes the information.
