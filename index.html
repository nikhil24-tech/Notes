  <h1>Nikhil's Notes</h1>
The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML), JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Front-end
developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web page
or app including buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.
  <h2>HTML</h2>
Hypertext Markup Language is the core of a website, providing the overall design
and functionality. The most recent version was released in late 2017 and is known
as HTML5.2. The updated version includes more tools aimed at web application
developers as well as adjustments made to improve interoperability.
<h2>CSS</h2>
Cascading style sheets give developers a flexible, precise way to create attractive,
interactive website designs.
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
This event-based language is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML
web pages. It allows developers to access elements separate from the main HTML
page, as well as respond to server-side events.
<h2>Back end</h2>
The back end, also called the server side, consists of the server which provides
data on request, the application which channels it, and the database which
organizes the information.

  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline CSS</li>
    <pre>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element.
an example of a very nicely STYLED web- site :
in our site :
 < body style="background-color: pink;"> - to change the entire background of
   our site.
    for custom- colours : < body style="background-color: #FCD8D4;">
one of the most professional sources for picking up colours are available:</pre>
<li>Internal CSS</li>
<pre>Internal CSS :
  An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a
  unique style.
  The internal style is defined inside the < style > element, inside
  the head section.
  There are some Chrome's Plugin to implement CSS-"Pesticide".
  This is a example of using internal css
< head >
< style >
body {
background-color: #FCD8D4;
}
img {
height: 20px;
}
< /style >
< /head ></pre>
    <li>External CSS</li>
 <pre>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML
  pages. To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the < head >
  section of each HTML page, after creating a file "styles.css"
  (without the ""). It is better for us if we create the file within a
  folder- "css"within your project- space.
</pre>
  </ul>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<pre>
  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
  implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more
  than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
  displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
  scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
  There are three types for using Javascript.</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline JavaScript</li>
    <pre>< button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!< /button>
      <button onclick="createParagraph()">Click me!</button></pre>
    <li>External JavaScript</li>
    <pre>
      1. Create the .js file in same directory.
      2. Put the code in .js file.
      3. Link in your html file as shown below
      < script src="script.js" defer>< /script>
    </pre>
    <li>Internal JavaScript</li>
    <pre>< script>

  // JavaScript goes here

< /script></pre>
  </ul>


  </body>
</html>
